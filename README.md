# Data-Structure-Graph
Code repository for my Shiny application that renders a Data Structure Graph.

A Data Structure Graph is a graphical representation of either an ERD, or the meta-data of data elements that flow through an enterprise.

A Level 1 Data Structure Graph is a Graph representation of an Entity Relationship Diagram. A level 2 Data Structure Graph is a Graph representation of a Data Flow Diagram.

One of the key differences with these traditional methods and a Data Structure Graph is the two diagrams are represented mathematically as a network or graph. This allows us to do some level of structural analysis of the way data moves through either an organization or a particular database.

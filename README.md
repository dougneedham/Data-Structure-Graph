# Data-Structure-Graph
Code repository for my Shiny application that renders a Data Structure Graph.

A Data Structure Graph is a group of atomic entities that are related to each other, stored in a repository, then moved from one persistence layer to another, rendered as a Graph.

In a Level 1 Data Structure Graph, the atomic Entities are the Entities from an Entity Relationship Diagram with no attributes. In a level 2 Data Structure Graph the atomic Entities are the applications used throughout the Enterprise.

One of the key differences with these traditional methods and a Data Structure Graph is the two diagrams are represented mathematically as a network or graph. This allows us to do some level of structural analysis of the way data moves through either an organization or a particular database.
